Coinbase.NET
============

A C# library for the Coinbase API. Buy and Sell stuff with Bitcoins, or buy and sell Bitcoins themselves.

Before you can use this library, or the test application, you must add your Coinbase API Key and API Secret. If you do not have those, you must visit Coinbase.com and register for them. 

Disclaimer: I do not work for Coinbase.com. I CANNOT answer questions about why certain API calls do ro don't behave in any particular way. I CAN answer questions about this wrapper, which I wrote. 

Also, this is still a work in progress, and not in its final form. Use at your own risk, etc.
